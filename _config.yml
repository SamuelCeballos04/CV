          This project means my first participation on a research article EVER!
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I started this project as a way to comply with my social service hours, which are requested in order to get a bachelors degree. This was my first desktop application ever, so we (me and my team) had to learn a lot about installers, packages, dependencies, and development technologies such as Javascript, Python, HTML, and css files.
          This project made us all grow both professionally and as human beings since we were always supporting each other, as a team should be, and getting over everything together. The goal for this project was to bring a psychometric test to digital so we can collect data from several applicants of this test and save it for later analysis. 
          The result was so good, our mentors decided to document this process on a research article and send it to a biomedicine journal.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
